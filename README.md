# Core Algorithms [Classic, Numeric, and Set]

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm
- Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts
- Have used pseudocode as an intermediary step in writing a program
- Are interested in common computer science algorithms
- Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving

## Description

This is a sub-goal of [Core Algorithms][core-algos]. Reference that goal for more description, context, and resources.

Complete **ONLY** the [Classic](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms.md#classic), [Numeric](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms.md#numeric), and [Set Operations](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms.md#set-operations) algorithms, not the Sorting/Searching or Graphing/Geometry. That's a [separate goal][core-algos-adv]. :)

### Stretch

Pick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.

- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each algorithm identified above, there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm  _in a language other than JavaScript_.
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm _in a language other than JavaScript_.
